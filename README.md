Authors: Megan Lawson, Miya Livingston, and Sanika Rewatkar

This project utilizes supervised learning to classify tumors as benign or malignant based on physical characteristics computed from digitized images of fine-needle aspirates. Uses the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. 


Includes 2 supervised learning models-- K-nearest neighbors and Random Forest-- with parameter tuning via iterative analysis and grid search. Also includes EDA visualizations (heatmaps, boxplots) and PCA for data analysis.
